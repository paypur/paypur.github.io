## Next Tasks

We just finished a new 1.20.1 update adding quite a few roadmap items, plus a bug fix release making it stable. Next project is to work on another project briefly before starting 1.21 NeoForge ports.

1.19.2 and 1.18.2 are both considered stable. We plan at least 1 more bugfix release for each version, but its to be determined how many bug fixes make it to each which are not already coded.

## 1.21 Changes

This section contains various tweaks to tools that came up during the design or discussion of the Throwback update, but felt too large to make in 1.20. They will most likely happen in the first 1.21 release, though these features are subject to change.

### Smeltery

#### Smeltery Tank Cleanup

* Instead of fuel and ingot tanks, just have tanks and gauges.
* Smeltery will have 4000mb tank volume.
* Foundry will have the ingot tank volume.

#### Scorched Faucet Tweaks

* To better distinguish scorched from seared, planned to make it opaque as a more efficient on rendering pipe.
* Pair with obsidian gauges to see your fluid if needed.
* Not fully sold on this idea.


### Tools

#### Sword Guard and Stat Averaging

* Swords and cleavers will get a new tool part, sword guards, which replaces one of their handles.
    * Sword guards are a shield plating, allowing defensive material traits instead of offensive.
    * This notably gates swords to tier 2 outside of maybe copper, but given we have both daggers and hand axes in tier 1 I think that is fine.
* From there, many tools will get some stat adjustments with a focus on reducing tool part stat averaging. In most cases, we will just add up heads directly.
* Broad tool multipliers may get reduced a bit as a result. In particular, broad weapon durability is way higher than you need other than on scythes.

#### Better Slime Staffs

* Slimestaffs could benefit from materials rather than the rather random stats they currently have.
* Give them 2 bowlimbs, a [sword guard](#sword-guard-and-stat-averaging), and possibly a bowstring. Depends on whether I want 5 materials or 4.
* Likely keep around the crystal as a material, to apply different slot types.

#### Dual Wielding rework

* Dual wielding will be limited to small tools again.
* Dual wielding will no longer apply it's stat debuff.
* This allows broad tools to get a level of reach, which is not compatible with dual wielding.
* Consider letting broad tools get a second level of reach via ability slot.

### Defense Rework

Following sections contain a couple of changes to make plate armor more distinct from travelers, which is a little bit too good by comparison currently (as 1 defense slot does not quite compare to 1 ability slot).

After the changes, traveler's potential before rebalanced will be 3 defense slots plus 1 defensive material trait (gained 1 slot but lost 1 potential trait). Plate will have 4 defense slots plus 2 defensive material traits (gained 1 slot).

#### Slotless Defense slot

* To keep armor from scaling too quickly, give +1 defense slot from a slotless modifier.
* Most likely will do this using the armor trim modifier.
  * Different trim variants will still be cosmetic. But applying any variant grants a defense slot.
  * For armor like travelers goggles that do not fit trims, include an alternative form of trim that has no shapes, just materials. Crafted using any trim template.

#### Jeweled Hide

* With the introduction of many new types of maille, ancient hide feels a little redundant, just granting +1 defense slot.
* With the introduction of the ancient tool material, ancient hide is a bit confusing.
* To solve this, plan to replace ancient hide with jeweled hide, swapping the molten debris for molten diamond.
* On pickaxes, will continue to grant fortune.
* On armor, will grant revitalized.
* On ranged weapons, will grant a boost to use item speed, letting you move more quickly while drawing back.


## Multiblock

### Inverted Channels

* Slimesteel and Cinderslime can make channels and faucets.
* They work identically to seared/scorched channels/faucet except for one small difference: downwards pouring is replaced with upwards pouring.

### Smeltery interface

* Allows accessing the UI fluid tank
* Comparator signal for tank level
* On pulse, switches fluid order (bottom to top? Top to bottom?)

### Sublimery

The sublimery is currently targeted for release near the [Soul Forge](#soul-forge) build, as we do not believe its current design can stand on its own without the system it was designed to fuel.

* Upside-down smeltery unlocked at the beginning of the end.
* Created using slimestone (slime on end stone) and slimesteel/king's slime/queen's slime (undecided).
* Third variant of the multiblock melting structure, after the smeltery and foundry.
* Will support melting entities into gaseous experience instead of transitional entity melting.
* Will likely not support alloying (smeltery exclusive) or byproducts (foundry exclusive).
* Will likely have the same ore output rate as smelteries, though it will be configurable in case a modpack wishes it to be higher.

### Soul Oven

The soul oven is a reimagining of the high oven from [Tinkers' Steelworks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tinkers-steelworks). The oven will have many similar core mechanics, including:

* Instead of being heated using liquid fuels, it will use specific solid fuels. The choice of fuel may impact the melting result.
* The oven won't immediately heat up, rather it heats up over time. Once heated, it can easily reach temperatures and speeds higher than lava or blazing blood.
* The oven has several additional slots for "additives". These will work on a similar system to the part builder or [soul forge](#soul-forge) to map items into "materials" for changing the melting result.

We are still considering how this design best fits into the mod, and into the design of the [soul forge](#soul-forge).

### Soul Forge
<div class="hatnote" markdown=1>
Main page: [Soul Forge](soul-forge).
</div>

The soul forge is a planned multiblock for late game tool, modifier, and material crafting. The soul forge at earliest will come in 1.21. For more information, see [Soul Forge](soul-forge).

## Tools

### Halberds
<div class="hatnote">Earliest 1.21, may wait for 1.21.11</div>

* Tinkers' Construct implementation of the new vanilla spears.
  * Can dash.
  * Can jab.
* Crafted from a broad axe head, 2 tough handles, and likely a sword guard.
* Moved from Tinkers' Things as the reach halberd is made redundant by [dual wielding rework](#dual-wielding-rework)

### Materials

Several new material tiers are planned:

* **Tier 4F**: Tier 4 materials requiring the [Soul Forge](#soul-forge) instead of advanced alloying.
* **Tier 4E**: Tier 4 materials requiring early end access.
* **Tier 5**: Ultimate materials requiring combining severlal methods of material crafting.

### Slimesuit Slimy 2.0

**More Slime:**

* Instead of making the slimesuit from enderslime, make it from any slime type
* Use the soul forge to craft it.
* Each slime has different effects! Like clay for armor!

**More Materials:**

* All parts will work like slimeskulls, having multiple bases!
* Chestplates use bones to boost melee effects, or elytra for flight.
* Leggings and boots do other neat stuff, will write more on it here later.

### Slimeshields

* The missing shield type
* Lean into the bouncy aspect of slime with knockback and bouncing?
* Likely will hold off until after the slimesuit rework.

### Modifiers

**Mending**

* Consumes experience fluid from the tools tank to repair the tool
* Replaces mending moss
* May end up being a trait of one of the tier 4 or 5 materials

**Some modifier with a cool name**

* Consumes experience orbs to fill the tool's tank with XP
* Pairs well with mendings, hint hint
* You may also wish to pair some tanks with mending, goal is for mending to take fewer slots than unbreakable but more than overslime

**Dual Harvesting**

* Like dual wielding, but for harvest
* Will let you harvest blocks with the tool in the offhand in some way. May just clone the 1.12 logic, may require you to hold right click.
* May just allow without charging anything, if not may be an upgrade.

**Charge attack**

* Way to upgrade broad tools by granting them a special ability on holding right click

**Quick ability**

* Way to upgrade small tools by granting them a non-combat ability on pressing right click

**Backstep**

* Recreation of the rapier right click move from 1.12.

**Dash**

* Leggings modifier allowing you to dash forwards on keypress.
* Either by default or when upgraded, dash will deal damage like trident riptide.
* Can be used once in midair before needing to land.
* Purely horizontal movement.

## Worldgen

### Ichor Islands

* Ichor slimes?
* Ichor slime islands?
* Would all be on the ceiling
* Geodes may partially replace this, not sure.

### Teantium Ore

New end exclusive ore used in the soul forge. See the [Soul Forge](soul-forge#teantium-ore) for more information.

## API

### Global tool definitions

We want to add a system to allow addons to modify existing tool definitions using the [tool module](/docs/json/tool-definitions#tool-modules) system. This would allow adding any merging behavior from tool defintions to either a specific tool or a tool tag, such as a new trait or a new tool action.

It may be worth making tool definitions directly have merging behavior. This might be redundant to the global tool defintions, so the better of the two designs may be better alone.

### Modifier JSON merging

We want a system in place that will allow addons to add new behavior to existing JSON modifiers. This would work similarly to the existing modifier module system, simply adding additional modules that will get merged in later.

### Recipe Controlled Tool Parts

We are considering moving the definition of tool parts to the tool recipe JSON. This would allow better control over part swapping behavior, along with allowing multiple recipes for a single tool and addons adding recipes for an existing tools without overriding resources.

The first step for this change will be to move the part swapping code to the tool building recipe. This will reduce the number of recipes needed for things such as ammo to work.

### Migrate Away From Tool Loot Hook

We keep reconsidering whether the tool loot hook is worth having compared to modifiers just directly adding global loot modifiers.

### Slots in crafted modifiers

* Crafted modifiers will now store slots instea of just modifier ID and level.
* Will be stored as a list based on the order they were applied.
  * For example, luck will be stored as "ability, 1; slotless, 2".
  * A modifier that alternates ability than upgrade would be stored as "ability, 1; upgrade, 1; ability, 1". Order is important.
* Benefits:
  * Simplifies modifier removal as the tool specifies how to remove them, no need to define extra recipes.
  * If a modifier changes types, you can remove the old application to recover the old slot.
  * If a modifier can be obtained in multiple ways, in theory this is usable to allow both to be mixed with the right type removing.
  * No need to track used modifiers in persistent data, making it easier to drop should it be impractical with components.
